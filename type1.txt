to your operator's licence.
Please note the operator of the Photo LIDAR system used in the detection
of this offence is a qualified operator. The system was tested before and
after the noted offence time at the location indicated.

court or a guilty plea will not result in any demerit points being assessed
to your operator's licence.
Please note the operator of the Photo LIDAR system used in the detection
of this offence is a qualified operator. The system was tested before and
after the noted offence time at the location indicated.

of this offence is a qualified operator. The system was tested before and
after the noted offence time at the location indicated.
